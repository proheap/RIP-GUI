## ASSIGNMENT
- Analysis of available RFC documents describing the theoretical properties of the RIP routing protocol
- Design of suitable algorithms and data structures based on the analysis of RFC documents 
- Implementation of selected RIP functions in Python (backend) language in LinuxOS
- Creating a user friendly interface for program control (frontend), e.g. WebGUI running on a local web server
- Testing - verification and validation of the resulting program:
    - use of software tools in a virtualized environment, napr. FRR, Cumulus Linux
    - deployment of the program in the network in KIS laboratories and testing by connecting it to real network devices
